/*Runtime Polymorphism (or Dynamic polymorphism)
It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch.
 Dynamic polymorphism is a process in which a call
 to an overridden method is resolved at runtime, 
 thats why it is called runtime polymorphism. 
 I have already discussed method overriding in detail in a separate tutorial, refer it: Method Overriding in Java.
